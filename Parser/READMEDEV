if you get any parse error on input =  errors,
remove the tab indentation. (check the rest of the generated files)

the isALpha etc are part of some kind of char package, google it.

Parse error: naked expression at top level
== 
parseError :: [Token] -> a
    parseError _ = error "Parse error" 
THat 2nd tab shouldnt be there :) OR main = should be HappyParser = since thats our module name
OR use main = getContents >>= print . parse . lexer
instead of main getContents >>= print . parse . lexer since that would be a naked expression; as in, not wrapped up
in a function definition


TODO;
Import expressions and lexer
pass input to top level parser function and return output
recursively parse said output to produce the lambda expression result. start simple
