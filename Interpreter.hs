--dropWhile = leave out of returnlist if true. So commas themselves are left out
--break = basically split: break creates a tuple of two lists from the original one separated at condition boundary 
--so we break on a comma, then word becomes whatever is before that comma, str'' becomes the rest.
--we then add word to the returnlist and recurse into str''
